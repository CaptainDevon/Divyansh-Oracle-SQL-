# Oracle SQL and PL/SQL Practice Repository

This repository provides a comprehensive set of Oracle SQL scripts for practicing and mastering database concepts, including Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Query Language (DQL). The scripts are designed to demonstrate real-world database design, data population, and advanced querying techniques.

## Directory Structure

- **DDL_Exercise.sql**  
  Contains scripts for creating normalized tables (`employees`, `departments`, `jobs`, `locations`) with primary and foreign key constraints, showcasing relational schema design and referential integrity.

- **DDL.sql**  
  Demonstrates table creation, alteration, renaming, truncation, and dropping. Includes constraint management and schema evolution operations, as well as table structure descriptions.

- **DML.sql**  
  Provides sample data insertion for all tables, simulating realistic business scenarios. Includes select statements for data verification.

- **DQL.sql**  
  Features a wide range of SQL queries, including:
  - Basic selects and filtering
  - Aggregations and grouping
  - Subqueries and correlated subqueries
  - Joins across multiple tables
  - Advanced analytical queries
  - Distinct, ordering, and limiting results

## PL/SQL and SQL Insights

- **Database Design:**  
  Demonstrates normalized schema creation, use of primary and foreign keys, and best practices for relational database design.

- **DDL Operations:**  
  Shows proficiency in creating, modifying, and managing database objects and constraints.

- **DML Operations:**  
  Includes bulk data insertion and data verification, supporting realistic data scenarios.

- **DQL Mastery:**  
  Contains complex queries for data analysis, reporting, and business intelligence, including multi-table joins, subqueries, and aggregations.

- **PL/SQL Readiness:**  
  The structured approach and use of Oracle-specific features (such as `VARCHAR2`, constraints, and advanced querying) reflect readiness for PL/SQL procedural programming, including writing stored procedures, functions, and triggers.

## Usage

1. Set up an Oracle Database environment.
2. Run `DDL_Exercise.sql` or `DDL.sql` to create tables and schema.
3. Run `DML.sql` to insert sample data.
4. Use `DQL.sql` to practice and test queries.
